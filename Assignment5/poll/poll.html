        Usage Scope
        ReactJs - React is a  JavaScript library for building Responsive User Interfaces for Building Web Application.
        React Native - It is a framework for creating mobile applications with a native feel.
        Syntax
        Both React and React Native uses JSX (JavaScript XML)  syntax but React uses html tags like <div> <h1> <p> etc while React Native uses <view> <text> etc.
         Animation And Gestures
        React uses CSS animations on a major scale to achieve animations for a web page while  The recommended way to animate a component is to use the Animated API provided by React-Native.
        Routing Mechanism
        React uses a react-router for routing and does not have any inbuilt routing capabilities but React Native has a built-in Navigator library for navigating mobile applications. <button onclick="testFunc()">Contunie</button>
